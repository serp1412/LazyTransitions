 # Thanks for trying out LazyTransitions!

 In this playground you'll find a series of pages showing several use cases for this framework.

 If you're new to playgrounds, here's a step by step tutorial on how to use them inside this project.

 1. First you'll need to make sure `LazyTransitions` scheme is selected and will be built on a simulator (make sure it's not pointing to a device or Generic iOS Device)

 2. Build the framework `CMD + B`
 3. Open any of the pages from the playground, you'll find them if you open the playground

 4. Once you select a page, click the `Assistant Editor` and then select to dispaly the `Live View` of the current playground page
